# Contributing to QSS — Quranic Systems Science

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

This repository is part of the **Quranic Systems Science (QSS)** initiative, whose goal is to study the Quran as a structured information system using reproducible, computational, and falsifiable methods.

## 🎯 Scope of contributions

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Bug fixes in analysis scripts
- Improvements to numerical stability or performance
- Reproducibility improvements
- Clarifications in documentation
- Additional verification experiments
- Translation improvements (fr / en / ar)
- Better visualization or figure generation scripts

---

## 🚫 What is NOT accepted

- Any modification that breaks reproducibility
- Any change that alters results without rigorous justification
- Any numerological or cherry-picked analysis
- Any change that is not fully explained and testable

This is a **scientific and structural analysis project**, not a religious or philosophical debate platform.

> This project is not about belief or blind acceptance. 
> It is about **verifiability, structure, and falsifiability**.

If you are here to test, challenge, or strengthen the results: you are welcome.  
If you are here to argue ideology: this is not the place.
